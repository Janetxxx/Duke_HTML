Some images are copyrighted
  laws
  ok for non-commercial use, like personal use
  usage rights with copyright holder
Some images in public domain
  wikimedia commons
  creative commons
Inline or Hot linking
  for personal pages, copyrights usually ok
  websites with lots of traffic? maybe a concern
Finding Links to Online Photos
  create links to photos found online
    right-click and copy URL, then paste
Some sites don't allow hot-linking
  e.g. pixabay
  need to test your webpage
    use incognito or private browsing

You are creating a website that has multiple images. Instead of saving the images and installing them on their own server you choose to create a link within your page with the URL of the original sever. This process is known as: inline linking.
